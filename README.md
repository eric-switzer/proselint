### Usage

Suppose you had a document `text.md` with the following text:

```
John is very unique.
```

You can run `proselint` over the document using the command line:

```bash
‚ùØ proselint text.md
```

This prints a list of suggestions to stdout, one per line. Each suggestion has the form:

```bash
text.md:<line>:<column>: <check_name> <message>
```

For example,

```bash
text.md:0:10: wallace.uncomparables Comparison of an uncomparable: 'unique' cannot be compared.
```

The command-line utility can also print suggestions in JSON using the `--json` flag. In this case, the output is considerably richer:

```javascript
{
    // Type of check that output this suggestion.
    check: "wallace.uncomparables",

    // Message to describe the suggestion.
    message: "Comparison of an uncomparable: 'unique' cannot be compared.",

    // The person or organization giving the suggestion.
    source: "David Foster Wallace"

    // URL pointing to the source material.
    source_url: "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/9715551"

    // Line where the error starts.
    line: 0,

    // Column where the error starts.
    column: 10,

    // Index in the text where the error starts.
    start: 10,

    // Index in the text where the error ends.
    end: 21,

    // start - end
    extent: 11,

    // How important is this? Can be "suggestion", "warning", or "error".
    severity: "warning",

    // Possible replacements.
    replacements: [
        {
            value: "unique"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Running Automated Tests

Automated tests are included in the `proselint/tests` directory. To run these tests locally, use the test runner [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and run the following commands:
```bash
cd tests/
nosetests 
```
and watch the output. Nose is compatible with Python versions 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. 

All automated tests in `tests/` are run as part of each submitted pull request, including newly added tests.
